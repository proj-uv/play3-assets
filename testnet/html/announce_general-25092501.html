Hello, PLAYERS! 👋<br/>
Welcome to PLAY3 — your friendly, mission-powered gateway to Web3.<br/>

 <strong>[ 🕵️‍♂️ PLAY3 Hide-and-Seek: Find the Hidden Mod! ] </strong><br/>
Every day, the Mods will sneak around the platform… can you spot them first? <br/>

<strong>📅 Event Period</strong> : Sep 25 ~ Oct 1 <br/>  
👉 8 rounds will be held each day, so keep your eyes wide open! <br/>  

<strong>✨ How to Join</strong><br/>  
1️⃣ PLAY3 will let you know when each hide-and-seek round begins via Telegram. <br/> 
2️⃣ Mysterious hints will drop in the PLAY3 chat and our Telegram channel. <br/>  
3️⃣ Use the clues to track down the Hidden Mod wandering around PLAY3. <br/>  
4️⃣ If you find them, quickly send a Trade Request! <br/>  
⦁ Only the first 3 successful Trade Requests per round will count. <br/>  

<strong>🏆 Rewards (per round)</strong><br/>  
🥇 1st Place: 500 Copper <br/>

<strong>📜 Event Notice</strong><br/>
By participating in this PLAY3 event, you agree to the following:<br/>
⦁ Winners are determined by the <strong>moderator operating the hide-and-seek round at that time</strong>, based on the order of <strong>successful Trade completions</strong>.  <br/>
⦁ If a Trade attempt is interrupted due to network delay, connection loss, or server issues, the next participant whose Trade is successfully completed will take the corresponding place.  <br/>
⦁ At the request of the moderators, the PLAY3 team may review <strong>system logs</strong> to help clarify the situation.  <br/>
⦁ Only valid PLAY3 accounts are eligible. Accounts under suspension, penalties, or abnormal activity are excluded.  <br/>
