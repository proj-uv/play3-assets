Hello, PLAYERS! 👋 <br/>

<strong>✨ The PLAY3 Open Beta has now been live for two months.</strong><br/>
🙏 We sincerely thank all participants for contributing to the growth of PLAY3. <br/>

<strong>Going forward, PLAY3 will continue as an open beta service available to everyone.</strong><br/>
We will keep expanding the platform by introducing enjoyable content and new onboarding initiatives, while working together with our community to explore the full potential of Web3.<br/>

We would also like to express our gratitude to our players, onboarding game partners, and the XPLA mainnet team for their continued support.<br/>

🚀 Further updates and new experiences are already on the way. <br/>

<strong>   ∘ 🎉 The leaderboard is live! Also, we are excited to announce the Bonus Events connected to our Open Beta Airdrop! Check the link below to follow both event details and rankings.</strong><br/>

   ∘ After the event concludes, verification and participant review may take up to 2–3 weeks at most. Detailed timelines will be shared in a follow-up announcement. We will also provide an update if the verification process finishes earlier, is delayed, or if there are any changes.<br/>
   ∘ Rewards will be distributed within one month after the official winner announcement, following the completion of the verification period.<br/>
   ∘ All rewards will be calculated based on the 7-day average closing price on CoinMarketCap, taken up to the day prior to distribution. Rewards will then be delivered to your PLAY3 inbox with a 1-month claim period, and a separate notice will be issued once distribution has been completed.<br/>
Please review the detailed event policy below as well : <br/>

<strong>📜 Event Notice</strong><br/>
By participating in any PLAY3 event, you agree to our operating policies and actions.<br/>
 ⦁ The platform or the event host may take necessary measures to ensure fair play and holds the final decision-making authority.<br/>
 ⦁ Event participation and rewards are based on an active, valid account in PLAY3. Accounts under restriction (suspension, withdrawal, penalties, etc.) are not eligible.<br/>
 ⦁ Top Ticket Holders (1st–3rd) are confirmed through internal review, based on raffle ticket acquisition records and activity logs.<br/>
 ⦁ If any abnormal participation or system abuse is detected — such as intentional account transfers or disguised participation — rewards will be forfeited.<br/>
 ⦁ If a winner is found to have engaged in misconduct, their prize will be revoked and awarded to the next eligible participant in rank order.<br/>
 ⦁ Rewards will only be confirmed after all verification processes are complete.<br/>
 ⦁ The platform is not responsible for technical issues, late participation, or missing evidence caused by factors beyond PLAY3’s control.<br/>
 ⦁ During review, proof or additional verification may be requested.<br/>
