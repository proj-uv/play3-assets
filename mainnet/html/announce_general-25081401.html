<strong>📜 Event Notice</strong>

<strong>By participating in any PLAY3 event, you agree to our operating policies and actions.</strong>

  ⦁ Only submissions received within the official event period will be considered.
  
  ⦁ The platform or the event host may take necessary measures to ensure fair play and holds the final decision-making authority.
  
  ⦁ Event participation and rewards are based on an active, valid account in PLAY3. Accounts under restriction (suspension, withdrawal, penalties, etc.) are not eligible.
  
  ⦁ Top Ticket Holders (1st–3rd) are confirmed through internal review, based on raffle ticket acquisition records and activity logs.
  
  ⦁ If any abnormal participation or system abuse is detected — such as intentional account transfers or disguised participation — rewards will be forfeited.
  
  ⦁ If a winner is found to have engaged in misconduct, their prize will be revoked and awarded to the next eligible participant in rank order.
  
  ⦁ Rewards will only be confirmed after all verification processes are complete.
  
  ⦁ The platform is not responsible for technical issues, late submissions, or missing evidence caused by factors outside of PLAY3’s control.
  
  ⦁ During review, proof or additional verification may be requested.
